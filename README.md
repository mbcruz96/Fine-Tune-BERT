# Fine-Tune-BERT
- The BERT tranformer model was fine-tuned for the down-stream task of sentiment classification.
- Another classifier was trained on the same transformer using linear probing so that the previous model parameters were not trained with the new classifier.
- The classification precision and accuracy of both models were compared.
